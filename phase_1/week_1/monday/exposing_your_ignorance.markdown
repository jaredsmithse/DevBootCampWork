### Instructions
1. Read the Apprenticeship Pattern on [exposing your ignorance](http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596518387/emptying_the_cup.html#expose_your_ignorance)
2. Answer the following questions:

#####*When have you chosen not to expose your ignorance, and what impact did it have on your effectiveness?*

In school, we needed a C or better to pass on. My first year of school was hard because I didn't know anything
about coding, so the CS classes were extremely hard. Once I got a D on a data structures class not just because
I didn't fully learn the material, but because I had huge holes in the underlying fundamentals required to 
understand the material. I managed to get by groupwork by nodding and agreeing the moment I remotely understood 
something, never asking questions. This method led to no filling in of those holes and I carried on this habit to 
my teacher when I talked to them about letting me move on to the next class even though I did not meet the minimum
grade requirement, setting myself up for failure in the next class.

#####*What are the 5 things you feel like you understand the least about computer programming? Try to keep it to stuff that you've tried to understand in the past.*

1. Big-O Notation and Time Complexity
2. Optimization
3. Pointers (especially pointers to pointers)
4. Binary trees
5. Recursion

#####*What is the way you feel most comfortable exposing your ignorance?*
Being in an environment where everyone is asking question that are around as 'dumb' as mine (I'm not asking what SQL stands
for when everyone is asking about how MySQL is more efficient than Microsoft's SQL implementation)
