## Instructions
1. Read the following articles on pairing:
  * [Pair Flow](http://www.markhneedham.com/blog/2008/10/17/pair-programming-pair-flow/)
  * [Pairing Pitfalls](http://pragprog.com/magazines/2012-03/four-common-pairing-pitfalls-and-how-to-avoid-them) 
2. Answer the following questions inline. Remember, there are no wrong answers!

### *What did you enjoy about pairing?*

If you want to rush through something, the other pair will typically slow you down either to understand it better themselves or 
just because they want to make sure its done right. If you are with someone more experienced, it helps you learn. If you are 
with someone less experiences, it reinforces your learning explaining things to them.

### *What can you do to help future pairing sessions be more like that?*

Make sure I ask questions and to make sure that I am open and receptive to my pair so that they know they can interrupt
or ask questions/correct me at any time.

### *What didn't you enjoy about pairing?*

Sometimes it can be frustrating communicating an idea that you know 'just works', but ultimately this is great because it is 
valuable practice for expressing thoughts.

### *What can you do to help future pairing sessions have less of that?*

Get better at communicating.

### *If you could tell future pair partners one thing about how to help your pairing session be productive and joyful, what would it be?*

Be extremely open to everything. Feel free to ask me 'why the hell are you doing it that way??' because there is a good 
probability you are right and I need to be corrected. Don't be afraid to speak up!
